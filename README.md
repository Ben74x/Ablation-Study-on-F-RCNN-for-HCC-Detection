# Ablation Study On Faster RCNN For HCC Detection
The codebase for my postgraduate thesis can be found in this repository. The common type of liver cancer, hepatoma, has been thoroughly studied using the Faster RCNN model.

This project's main objective is to evaluate the performance (speed and accuracy) of Faster RCNN model on the liver cancer detection with various backbones and parameters.
